Healthcare Chatbot for Symptom Diagnosis

This project presents a healthcare chatbot powered by machine learning to assist users in identifying potential diseases based on their reported symptoms. Utilizing both Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, the chatbot analyzes symptom inputs to provide possible diagnoses.

Key Features:

Symptom-Based Diagnosis: The chatbot takes user-described symptoms as input and processes them through trained machine learning models to suggest potential conditions.
Disease Information: For the predicted diseases, the chatbot offers descriptions and relevant precautions.
Multilingual Support: The chatbot includes a language selection option (English and Hindi) to cater to a wider user base, leveraging the Google Translate library for communication.
Machine Learning Models: The project utilizes Decision Tree and SVM algorithms for classification, trained on a dataset of symptoms and corresponding diseases.
Data Handling: The code demonstrates loading and preprocessing of symptom data from CSV files, including label encoding for disease names.
This project can serve as a foundational example for building interactive healthcare applications with machine learning capabilities and multilingual support.
